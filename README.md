Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python repository! This repository is your ultimate guide to mastering OOP concepts in Python, with easy-to-understand examples and real-world use cases.

🚀 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that structures code around objects rather than functions and logic. In Python, OOP makes your code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

📋 Features of This Repository

1. Core OOP Concepts

Classes and Objects: Learn how to define and use classes and objects in Python.

Attributes and Methods: Understand how to create and manipulate object properties and actions.

Encapsulation: Discover how to hide data and protect it from unintended access.

Inheritance: Reuse and extend functionalities of existing classes.

Polymorphism: Explore how objects can take many forms through method overriding and operator overloading.

Abstraction: Simplify complex systems by focusing on the essentials.

2. Advanced Topics

Magic Methods (Dunder Methods): Dive into special methods like __init__, __str__, and more.

Decorators: Understand how decorators work in classes.

Class vs. Static Methods: Learn the differences and when to use them.

Metaclasses: Gain insight into the class of a class.

3. Hands-On Examples

Real-world projects demonstrating OOP principles:

Bank Account System: Manage accounts, deposits, and withdrawals.

Library Management System: Track books, members, and borrow/return activities.

E-commerce System: Implement products, customers, and orders.

4. Best Practices

Write clean and modular OOP code.

Use docstrings and type hints for better readability and maintainability.
